# ecto_dep_migrations - Project Summary

## Overview

This package enables Elixir dependencies to provide Ecto migrations that can be seamlessly integrated and run within Phoenix applications. It solves the limitation where dependencies cannot directly contribute migrations to the host application.

## Key Components

### 1. Mix Tasks

- **mix ecto.migrate.all** - Runs migrations from both the application and its dependencies
- **mix ecto.rollback.all** - Rolls back migrations from both the application and its dependencies

### 2. Migration Discovery

The package automatically discovers migrations from:
- Application: `priv/repo/migrations/*.exs`
- Dependencies: `_build/#{env}/lib/#{dep}/priv/ecto_migrations/*.exs`

### 3. Features

- Zero configuration required
- Full compatibility with standard Ecto options
- Support for multiple repositories
- Error handling and validation
- Comprehensive logging options

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
mix test
```

All 19 tests pass successfully.

## Publishing to Hex

To publish this package:

1. Update package metadata in `mix.exs` (maintainers, links)
2. Create a Hex account: `mix hex.user register`
3. Build docs: `mix docs`
4. Publish: `mix hex.publish`

## Usage Example

For applications:
```elixir
# In mix.exs
defp aliases do
  [
    "ecto.migrate": "ecto.migrate.all",
    "ecto.rollback": "ecto.rollback.all"
  ]
end
```

For dependencies providing migrations:
```
# Place migrations in:
priv/ecto_migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_migration_name.exs
```
